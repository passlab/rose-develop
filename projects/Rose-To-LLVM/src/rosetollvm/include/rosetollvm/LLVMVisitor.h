    /**
     * visit_suspended_by_node, initially NULL, is used to avoid visitation of the descendants of a node P.
     * To achieve this, the user sets visit_suspended_by_node to P when previsiting P. Once that's done, no
     * node Q such that Q != P will be visited as long as visit_suspended_by_node == P.  At the beginiing of
     * the post-visit function, when P is finally reached again, visit_suspended_by_node is reset to NULL,
     * allowing visitation to resume starting with a post-visitation of P itself. 
     *
     * This feature is important because there appears to be cases in Sage III where the Rose compiler
     * calculates the value of a constant expression at compile time, replaces the tree corresponding to the
     * constant expression by a Value node, but nonetheless, makes the original tree a subtree of the value
     * node in question. That subtree also gets traversed during a normal Pre/Post visit. Thus, to avoid
     * this problem, when we encounter a constant value (SgValueExp) during a visit, we instruct the visitor
     * to ignore all its descendants, if any.
     *
     * I suspect that the reason for this arrangement is to keep track of the original user-specification.
     * When in the course of semantic analysis a (AST) subtree has been resolved to another subtree, It would
     * have been desirable for Rose to allow the user to pass an argument to the visitor to instruct it as to
     * what to do when it encounters a "resolved" subtree. Namely, visit:
     *
     *  1. Original nodes only
     *  2. Resolved nodes only
     *  3. Both sets of nodes
