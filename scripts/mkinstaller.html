         DESCRIPTION
      </h3>
      <blockquote>
         This script is used to generate an "installer" script implemented as
         a Bourne-shell script on UNIX-like systems (such as Linux or OSX) or
         as a binary executable on Windows-like systems. This generated installer
         supports a number of options for specifying the where the various
         directories are to be installed (prefix directory pathnames).
      </blockquote>
      <blockquote>
         <b>UNIX-like Host</b>
         <blockquote>
            On a UNIX-like host (such as Linux or OSX) the generated installer
            script is implemented as a self-extracting Bourne-shell script
            carrying a tarball as a payload. <i>mkinstaller</i> requires <i>tar</i> on UNIX-like
            hosts.

            The installer script construction process:
            <blockquote>
               <ol>
                  <li>Determination of a suitable temp directory. Much of the work
                      done by the mkinstaller script is done in a temp directory.
                  </li>
                  <li>Creation of a top level temporary directory under which all
                      other temporaries will be created. Creation of an "accumulator",
                      an "intermediate" and a "wrapper" directory in the top level
                      temp directory. A tarup/untar process will use both the
                      "intermediate" and "accumulator" directories to merge given
                      directories with the same basename. The "wrapper" directory
                      will be used to carry the individual directory tarballs.
                  </li>
                  <li>From each of the specified directories to be installed such
                      as .../bin, .../lib, specified on the mkinstaller command line
                      tarup the individual directory forming tarballs in the wrapper
                      directory in the temp directory.
                  </li>
                  <li>Tarup the temporary wrapper directory for eventual inclusion
                      in the generated installer.
                  </li>
                  <li>Generate the text of the "installer" script in the temporary
                      directory customizing it with with options for specifying an
                      overall prefix directory and individual prefixes for each of
                      the directories specified on the mkinstaller command line.
                  </li>
                  <li>Add the tarball built in (4) to the end of the script generated
                      in (5) forming the distribution self-extracting installation
                      script in the directory where <i>mkinstaller</i> was run.
                  </li>
                  <li>Cleanup.
                  </li>
               </ol>
               In the end the only product is the desired distribution self-
               extracting installation script in the directory where the
               <i>mkinstaller</i> command was run. Everything else produced along the
               way (directories and files) is considered temporary and is
               destroyed.

               has no extension.
            </blockquote>
            How the generated installer script works on a UNIX-like target:
            <blockquote>
               <ol>
                  <li>The installer script locates itself. This may seem to be an
                      obvious and or silly question but the actual location of the
                      script file is necessary for the actual extraction (the script
                      file must be read by the standard "tail" utility).
                  </li>
                  <li>Determination of a suitable temp directory. Much of the work
                      done by the generated installer script is done in a temp
                      directory. Creation of a top level temporary directory under
                      which all other temporaries will be created. This temp
                      directory is created under the standard temp directory
                      determined at the start of this step (see NOTES).
                  </li>
                  <li>PREFIX and PREFIX_<i>xxx</i> values are established from command
                      line options. If appropriate options aren't supplied to
                      install all directories then the installer script will propmpt
                      for the necessary pathname(s). The installer script will
                      create the directories if necessary.
                  </li>
                  <li>The tarball embedded in the installer script is extracted from
                      the installer script into the temp directory created in (2).
                  </li>
                  <li>The tarball in (4) is unwrapped revealing one or more tarballs
                      (one for each installation directory such as <b><big><code>bin.tar.gz</code></big></b>
                      <b><big><code>include.tar.gz</code></big></b> <b><big><code>lib.tar.gz</code></big></b> ...). If a pre-install script was
                      supplied to <i>mkinstaller</i> when the generated installer script
                      was produced then it will be revealed at this time. Similarly
                      if a post-install script was supplied to mkinstaller when the
                      generated installer script was produced then it will also be
                      revealed at this time. Note that neither of these scripts if
                      supplied and revealed are actually executed in this step. See
                      steps (6) and (8).
                  </li>
                  <li>If (5) revealed a pre-install script then it will be executed
                      by the approptiate interpreter. Note that each of the PREFIX
                      directories will be supplied as an option to this pre-install
                      script (such as <b><big><code>--prefix_bin=</code></big></b><i>pathname</i>). Also note at this time
                      the individual tarballs representing the directories to install
                      have NOT be unwrapped.
                  </li>
                  <li>Each individual tarball revealed (5) is unwrapped into the
                      approperiate PREFIX directory overlying anything already
                      there.
                  </li>
                  <li>If (5) revealed a post-install script then it will be executed
                      by the approptiate interpreter. Note that each of the PREFIX
                      directories will be supplied as an option to this post-install
                      script (such as <b><big><code>--prefix_bin=</code></big></b><i>pathname</i>).
                  </li>
                  <li>Cleanup.

         <b>Windows-like Host</b>
         <blockquote>
            On a Windows-like host (such as Windows 7) the generated installer
            is implemented as a binary execurable which is actually generated
            under the covers by <i>NSIS</i> (Nullsoft Scripted Install System).

         NOTES
      </h3>
      <blockquote>
         The directory where temporary files are to be placed is determined
         as follows:
         <blockquote>
            <ol start="0">
               <li>If <b><big><code>MKINSTALLER_TMPDIR</code></big></b> is defined and is not empty then
                   consider its value as a directory pathname. If this pathname
                   exists and is a directory and is writable then temporary
                   files will be placed in this directory. Otherwise...
               <li>If <b><big><code>TMPDIR</code></big></b> is defined and is not empty then consider its
                   value as a directory pathname. If this pathname exists
                   and is a directory and is writable then temporary files
                   will be placed in this directory. Otherwise...
               </li>
               <li>If <b><big><code>TMP</code></big></b> is defined and is not empty then consider its
                   value as a directory pathname. If this pathname exists
                   and is a directory and is writable then temporary files
                   will be placed in this directory. Otherwise...
               </li>
               <li>If <b><big><code>TEMP</code></big></b> is defined and is not empty then consider its
                   value as a directory pathname. If this pathname exists
                   and is a directory and is writable then temporary files
                   will be placed in this directory. Otherwise...
               </li>
               <li>If the user's home directory can be determined and if
                   this home directory contains a subdirectory named <b><big><code>tmp</code></big></b>
                   that is itself writable then temporary files will be
                   placed in this directory. Otherwise...
               </li>
               <li>If <b><big><code>C:</code></big></b><i>userProfile</i><b><big><code>\AppData\Local\temp</code></big></b> exists and is writable then temporary files
                   will be placed in this directory. Otherwise...
               </li>
               <li>If <b><big><code>/tmp</code></big></b> exists and is writable then temporary files
                   will be placed in this directory. Otherwise...
               </li>
               <li>If <b><big><code>/var/tmp</code></big></b> exists and is writable then temporary files
                   will be placed in this directory. Otherwise...
               </li>
               <li>If <b><big><code>C:\Temp</code></big></b> exists and is writable then temporary files
                   will be placed in this directory. Otherwise...
               </li>
               <li>If <b><big><code>C:\Windows\Temp</code></big></b> exists and is writable then temporary files
                   will be placed in this directory. Otherwise...
               </li>
               <li>If the current directory is writable then temporary
                   files will be placed in the current directory.
                   Otherwise...
               </li>
               <li>A fatal error message will be sent to <i>stderr</i> and
                   the script will exit with a non-zero exit code.
               </li>
